# Project-2
Hi, I completed a data analysis project. Using the YouTube Data API, a Python project will scrape YouTube content. We extract the data using the YouTube API, load it into a Python Pandas DataFrame, and do an analysis. Lastly, we use the Python Seaborn package to create a basic display from this data. So I chose 3 channels namely- Iamzackknight, mitraz and DJrash official and then through data analysis found out which particular channel had how many subscribers, views, comments, likes and how many months did they upload the video on and then displayed the data in a bar graph format through seaborn.
